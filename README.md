  Australian Stock Price Prediction
</h1>

**Project Description**: 
This project will use Descriptive analysis to identify patterns in time series data, like trends, cycles or seasonal variation as well as highlights
the main characteristics of the time series data. Dataset is open data collected from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashbellett/australian-historical-stock-prices?resource=download). 
Futhermore, I will use the Forecasting model for predicting future data based on the
historical data with different types. Then I will evaluate and compare the performance of these models against each other and choose the
best model. Finally, I will answer the inspiration questions raised at the beginning of the project.
